This is a solution to the reddit/r/dailyprogrammer problem featured here: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/4rug59/20160708_challenge_274_hard_loop_solver/

It has been tested compiling with clang++ --std=c++11 -lpthread

It produces text output showing each solution found, 
and each step of that soluction in order. 

This may be a lot of text.

after compiling,
you can test with `./inf_loop < *test`
where * is '', 'big_', or 'huge_'.
big and huge might take a long while.
